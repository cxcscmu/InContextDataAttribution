To add animations to a web page, you can use CSS animations, JavaScript, or third-party animation libraries. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Using CSS animations - In your CSS code, create a keyframes block that defines the stages of your animation. For example, here's a simple animation that changes the background color of an element from red to blue: ```css @keyframes changeColor { 0% { background-color: red; } 100% { background-color: blue; } } ``` - Next, apply the animation to the element you want to animate. You can do this by setting the `animation` property of the element in your CSS code. For example, here's how you can apply the `changeColor` animation to a `div` element with an `animated` class: ```css .animated { animation: changeColor 4s linear infinite; } ``` - The `animation` property is shorthand for several other animation-related properties. In the example above, `4s` is the duration of the animation, `linear` is the timing function, and `infinite` means that the animation should repeat indefinitely. 2. Using JavaScript - If you want to add more complex animations or interaction-based animations, you'll need to use JavaScript. To create an animation with JavaScript, you can use the `requestAnimationFrame` method to update an element's properties at regular intervals. - Here's an example that animates the position of a `div` element from left to right: ```javascript const element = document.querySelector('.animated'); let position = 0; function step() { position += 5; element.style.left = position + 'px'; if (position < 300) { requestAnimationFrame(step); } } requestAnimationFrame(step); ``` 3. Using third-party animation libraries - If you don't want to write the animation code yourself, you can use a third-party animation library like GreenSock or anime.js. These libraries provide easy-to-use APIs for creating complex animations, and can save you a lot of time and effort. - Here's an example that uses GreenSock's TweenMax library to animate the scale and rotation of a `div` element: ```javascript const element = document.querySelector('.animated'); TweenMax.to(element, 2, { scale: 2, rotation: 360 }); ``` To add animations to\n\nAdd two numbers: 8 and 11.

In binary: 2 is represented as 10 5 is represented as 101 Next, we can line them up, just as we would when adding numbers in the base-10 system. 10 + 101 _____ Starting from the rightmost column, we add the numbers: 0 + 1 = 1 So, we write down a 1. 10 + 101 ____1 Moving to the next column, we have: 1 + 0 = 1 So, we write down another 1. 10 + 101 ___11 There's one more column to add. 1 + 0 = 1 So, we write down another 1. 10 + 101 __111 There are no more columns to add, so we are done.

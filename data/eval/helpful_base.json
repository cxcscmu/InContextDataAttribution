Description of the Related Art\nGenerally, there are two methods for controlling a torque of a motor. A first method is to measure torque by driving a motor and detecting the torque based on a detection signal of a speed sensor. A second method is to drive a motor by measuring current by driving a motor and calculating a torque based on a detection signal of a speed sensor.\nThe first method includes a method of calculating an exact torque by measuring torque and calculating a current to control a motor based on a torque measuring value and a current measuring value, and a method of calculating an approximate torque by measuring current and calculating a torque based on a difference between an actual torque and a predicted torque.\nThe second method includes a method of measuring torque by driving a motor and calculating a current to control the motor by measuring a rotation speed of the motor and a speed of a load. In the second method, there is a problem in that the current to control the motor is large and the calculation amount of the torque is large.\nIn addition, the second method is complicated in calculating a torque and a current.\nThe present invention is contrived to solve the above problem.",

    "input":"",
    "output":"What is the cause of the decline in the number of large predators?\n\nThe first bears to be listed in the United States were killed in the state of Wyoming in 1930 by ranchers, farmers and hunters. The species was named for rancher Charles A. Horsley, who in 1883 established the first ranch on the Black Hills in South Dakota. The species was extinguished in the 1930s and not reintroduced or rehabilitated in the United States until the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s, the population of the bear was reduced by hunters and ranchers who used poisoned baits to capture the bears for their fur. The bears were reintroduced in 1982 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nWhat is the cause of the decline in the numbers of bears in the United States?\n\nBears are in decline due to habitat loss and fragmentation that has taken place over much of their range.\n\nWhat are some of the reasons that the bear population is declining?\n\nThe bears have lost many of their natural food sources. They have become accustomed to eating a variety of fruits and berries. The number of bears in the United States has declined because of human activities and habitat loss.\n\nWhat are some of the reasons that the bear population is increasing?\n\nThe bears have been expanding into new habitat, in particular the boreal forest.\n\nWhat is the main threat to the bears?\n\nIn the boreal forest, the bears and other animals are under reduced pressure.\n\nWhat is a bear trap?\n\nA bear trap is a device that traps a bear. The device is used to capture a bear so that it can be taken to a wildlife rehabilitation center or wildlife viewing area.\n\nWhat is the main threat to the bears in the United States?\n\nBears are under pressure from people and domestic animals that prey on them.\n\nWhat are some of the best places to see bears in the United States?\n\nBears can be seen year-round in the northern part of the U.S., in the west, in the south and in the southwestern states.\n\nWhich states are the best places to see bears in the United States?\n\nThe best places to see bears in the United States are in the north, in the west and in the south.\n\nWhat are some of the best places to see bears in the United States?",

Kirby was the first to use the \"L\" word, which is also the initials for the word \"legend.\" Buechler also used the word \"legend\" in his script.\n\nKirby's first script was actually a reworking of Buechler's original.\n\nThe first time a new Superman story was written, it was an updated, larger-than-life version of the character.\n\nThe original Superman story had him travel to \"Earth-One\" and meet the super-intelligent alien race known as \"the Kents\". This story was based on the work of artist Joe Gill, who had created a series of Superman comics in the 1940s and who had worked with Kirby before.\n\nSome time later, the Kents kidnapped Superman and demanded he return their planet. The Kents were very upset when Superman refused and left. The story then went on to explain that the Kents were not happy with being treated so unfairly and the Kents decided to take the \"L\" word back, creating the \"L\" word. The story was written by Jack Kirby, who also provided the art for the original comic book.\n\nThe Kents then gave Superman the \"L\" word, and the Kents were able to control the planet and send a rescue team to rescue Superman.\n\nThat is how it all started.\n\nThe story was later adapted into the comic book, but the script was written by Kirby.\n\nThe story was later adapted into the comic book, but the script was written by Kirby.\n\nThe story was later adapted into the comic book, but the script was written by Kirby.\n\nThe story was later adapted into the comic book, but the script was written by Kirby.\n\nWhen the story was written, Kirby had no idea that the Kents were going to use the \"L\" word.\n\nKirby was a writer.

These forms of volcanic activity are typically confined to smaller and smaller areas around a volcano.\n\nTuffs and lava flows are different in how they form. Volcanoes have a hard time breaking apart when they form, and instead form into small, small, small, and eventually into large lava flows.\n\nHow many times have you seen lava coming out of a volcano?\n\nLava is generated by volcanoes that have been erupting for thousands of years, and many volcanoes have erupted thousands of times.\n\nWhat is the difference between lava and magma?\n\nLava and magma are two separate types of volcanic activity. Volcanic lava is formed when magma rises to the surface and erupts from the volcano. Volcanic magma is formed when the magma is trapped beneath the surface of the volcano, and erupts through the volcano.\n\nHow can you create a volcano?\n\nCreating a volcano is easy, but it isn\u2019t an exact science. One of the main challenges that new volcanoes face is how to keep the magma from leaking out.\n\nWhen magma is trapped beneath the surface, it is trapped inside the volcano. It can be trapped in the lava tubes, which are small cracks in the volcanic rock that allow for the magma to escape.\n\nIt can also be trapped in the magma. It can be trapped in the volcanic gases or in the lava, or both.\n\nThe magma can also be trapped in the cracks or holes in the volcanic rocks. The magma can also be trapped in the cracks or holes in the volcanic rocks.\n\nHow do volcanoes create lava flows?\n\nLava flows are formed by lava that has dripped and seeped down from the volcano. The dripped lava flows can form either on the surface of the volcano or in the cracks and holes in the rock that are formed by the lava.\n\nHow often does a volcano erupt?\n\nLava erupts from a volcano every hundred years or so, but there are many volcanoes that have never erupted",

If you think about it, they were almost the exact same thing as the person who committed the murders in the first place. The difference was that the person who committed the murders was someone who had some kind of personality disorder. That's not to say that there wasn't an undercurrent of paranoia and fear about them, but the public was generally pretty upset about it, and they were able to control it by being more careful about reporting it.\n\nSecond, we weren't just talking about serial killers in the 80s and 90s. We're talking about people who murdered multiple people in a short amount of time. There was a lot of attention given to serial killers in the 70s and 80s, but we weren't talking in the same way about serial killers in the 90s and 2000s. The fact that we weren't talking about them in the same way in the 2000s is a good thing.\n\nI think, in addition to the public outrage over serial killers, the news media also took notice. The media coverage of serial killers was always very interesting. It was always a case of people saying, \"Oh, my God, that's terrible. He's the guy who killed all these people.\" But it was very interesting to see how much attention they had. This was mostly concentrated in the early part of the 20th century, when people were still being killed for a lot of other reasons.\n\nThere is also a very interesting idea about how serial killers got away with murder. It's something that comes up in my classes. One of the things that people talk about when they talk about serial killers is that the public were so afraid of them that they didn't report any of the crimes they committed. I think this is absolutely true. But I think there were other factors that contributed to their success.\n\nThe first one is the media attention. You don't have to be a celebrity to get media attention. I think there was a lot of attention given to serial killers because they were so unique. They didn't have any prior history or any kind of history of violence. They were a guy who killed his victims in a short amount of time. There was a very limited amount of information that people were given about how he killed them.\n\nThe second thing that helped is the fact that there was a lot of public outrage over serial killers.

The closer you get the better the water quality will be. The best water sources are the ones you can reach by foot.\n\nWhat is water scarcity?\n\nWater scarcity refers to the problem of having too much water in a given area. In a population of 1000 people there is only one of these people: in fact, the whole population lives on a single water source.\n\nWater scarcity is also called the water deficit problem.\n\nWhat is water scarcity policy?\n\nWater scarcity policy is a set of regulations that aim to provide a minimum standard of water quality for all areas of the population. The best way to measure water quality is to look at how water is being used in the population. Using water in this way can be very efficient, since the water quality is constantly monitored and managed.\n\nWhat do water scarcity and water security have in common?\n\nThe two are very close to each other.\n\nWater security refers to the fact that water quality is good enough to allow you to stay healthy and alive.\n\nWater scarcity refers to the fact that, at the moment, there are not enough water sources. This problem is usually caused by the fact that natural resources are becoming scarcer, and in most cases this is because of human activity.\n\nHow can I improve water quality?\n\nThe best way to improve water quality is to ensure that the water we use is clean. This is the first step.\n\nThe second step is to ensure that a minimum amount of water is used. This is a way to ensure that the water we use is safe.\n\nThere is also a third step. We should use water as efficiently as possible.\n\nThese three steps are very important.\n\nHow can I tell if I have water scarcity?\n\nIf you have water scarcity, you should be able to drink it. If you can drink it, it is a good sign. If you cannot drink it, it is a bad sign. It can be that you have water scarcity because you are using a lot of water, or because the water is dirty.\n\nWhat is the best water quality?\n\nThe best water quality is defined as the water quality that is the most adequate for",

It is certainly true that the Japanese were prisoners of war during WWII, but this was true of many other Allied prisoners too, including Australians, New Zealanders, and many other countries.\nThe Japanese were prisoners of war because the Japanese government wanted to establish a puppet Japanese nation to provide them with bases in the Pacific to counter the Allied advance into Asia. This was not to be a democracy, but a puppet state to be ruled by the Japanese government in Tokyo.\nThis is true even today. If you go to a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo, you will see signs saying \"Japanese prisoners of war are not allowed to eat\". This is true for all people of all nationalities, including some native Australians.\n\nWhat is the truth?\n\nA:\n\nI think this is a very good question and a very interesting one. It is a question that has been asked many times and has many different answers.\nIn answer to your question, I would say:\n\nyes, the Japanese were prisoners of war during World War II. However, this is not the same as the truth. While this is true, the Japanese were in fact prisoners of war.\n\nIt is not my intention to say that the Japanese were prisoners of war, but my point is that they were prisoners of war. This is the truth.

This is not to be a democracy, but a puppet state to be ruled by the Japanese government in Tokyo. However, this is not the same as truth.\nThis is the truth.\n\nA:\n\nThey were prisoners of war, yes, but not for the reason you think. They were prisoners of war because they were the only country that had the power to make war on the Japanese Empire.\nThe Japanese were prisoners of war because they were the only country whose military could fight the Japanese Empire.\n\nQ:\n\nHow to get the name of a column from a row in a mysql table?",

    "output":"The best way to think about Christmas wreaths is to think about the meaning of the whole of it. You may be able to find a meaning for Christmas wreaths, but it is not the same as the meaning of Christmastime itself.\n\nThe idea of Christmastime is that the world is in need of a Savior and that he came to save us. But the world does not need a Savior; it needs a Savior and the only Savior that it needs is Jesus Christ.\n\nWe are all called to be children of God, and we are called to be children of the church. But the world does not need us to be children of God; it needs our God-given ability to love others. Our Savior came to save us, but we are not called to be children of God.\n\nChristmas wreaths are a way of remembering this truth. They are a reminder that the world needs a Savior and that he came to save us. And that he came to save us is a reminder that God is our Savior and that we are children of God.\n\nI think that in the past people have made wreaths out of a variety of different materials. But I think that the most important thing is the meaning. If you were to come to Christ the Christmas wreath would be a reminder of the fact that you are called to be a child of God. And the Christmas wreath is a reminder that you are a child of the church, and that you are a child of God.\n\nI think that all kids have a place where they can feel the presence of God. When they feel the presence of God, they can feel the presence of Jesus. But that place can be a very special place.\n\nFor example, I think that it is a special place for the child of God to feel the presence of God. It is a special place where the child of God can feel the presence of God. And the Christmas wreath is a special place where the child of God can feel the presence of God.\n\nThe Christmas wreath is a special place where the child of God can feel the presence of God.

The amidation reaction is carried out in the presence of a basic catalyst and a solvent, and the amidation reaction is carried out at a high temperature, so that the amidation reaction is easily accompanied by a side reaction. As a result, the amidation reaction is not always favorable.\nThe amidation reaction can be carried out in a relatively small amount of a solvent, which is advantageous to the amidation reaction, but in the amidation reaction carried out in the presence of a large quantity of a basic catalyst, the amidation reaction is accompanied by a side reaction, so that a very high temperature is required to carry out the amidation reaction. Moreover, the amidation reaction is accompanied by a side reaction, and the amidation reaction is difficult to be carried out stably and to be industrially advantageous.\nRecently, an amidation reaction for the am",

The aim of the therapy is the total removal of the tumor and the restoration of the normal breast tissue. The choice of the treatment depends on the stage of the disease, the prognostic factors and the therapy to be used. The treatment of recurrent breast cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy with or without endocrine therapy. The use of surgery is the most effective. The radiotherapy is more effective in reducing local recurrence and improving the long-term results of the disease. Finally, the combination of chemotherapy with or without endocrine therapy is the most effective therapy. The results of clinical trials of the treatment of recurrent breast cancer are presented.Q:\n\nHow to create a custom object in Java\n\nI have a custom class which has some static fields and some methods. \nHere is the class:\npublic class CustomObject {\n    public static final int size = 10;\n\n    static {\n        \/\/method 1\n    }\n}\n\nI am writing a class which extends CustomObject.

He told the kids that they could play on \"the street\" and if they didn't like the music they were going to get out of the truck and play the guitar.

The most common is if you have an active visa or have been in the US for a short period of time which would allow you to apply for asylum.  Other problems include having a criminal record, being the victim of a crime or any other reason that could allow you to be deported.\n\nA:\n\nIt's open as long as you have a valid passport, but check first.\nNo requirement for a visa, as long as you are in the USA, you can enter and exit the country without a visa for stays up to 90 days.\nThe border is closed, but the border patrol is working hard to keep the border safe.  Do not attempt to cross the border without a passport, even if you are a temporary visitor.\nYou are on the list for deportation, and you have a valid visa, so you are not deported.\n\nCytokine production by human peripheral blood lymphocytes activated by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid.\nPolyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (poly I ribo-ICP), a synthetic analogue of poly I-poly C, induced the production of several cytokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) activated by PMA. Poly I-ICP alone did not induce any cytokine production. Poly I-ICP together with PMA induced the production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in a dose-dependent manner. Poly I-ICP did not alter the effect of PMA on IL-2 production. Using the blocking antibody to IL-2, the production of IL-2 by PBMC activated by poly I-ICP was greatly inhibited. Interestingly, poly I-ICP (5-100 micrograms\/ml",

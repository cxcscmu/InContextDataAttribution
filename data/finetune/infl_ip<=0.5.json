Then I remember the first men and their caves,\nHow I laughed when they called me the Sea of Waves!\nThey made their gods of wood and stone,\nBut I was older than them all alone.\n\n\"When the Romans came with a heavy hand. Their palisades beside me stand,\nI remember their ships and their smart attacks\nAnd the time when C\u00e6sar nearly backed his pack.\nBut nothing that I remember more\nThan Queen Bess and the Spanish war,\nWhen the houses shook, and the ships were afeared\nAnd I the old Thames, carried the canard.\n\n\"Then there was a man with a stick in his clutch.\nRaising it high, with a shaking touch,\nAnd that was Nelson, in 'tween the guns,\nAnd that was the end of the Spanish plans.\n\"And now I'm watching the sweeter sight \u2013\nThe Tower Bridge, all in the light,\nWatching the yacht that is standing by;\nAnd the folk that wonder as they go by.\"\n\nSo, from the sad tale of the River's past,\nComes the triumphant trumpet blast \u2013\nIn the mighty walls of the Tower fort,\nThe Thames whispers on in its lordly sort."

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

The ATP Finals are held in November at the O2 Arena in London, England.\n\nFirst held in 1970, the tournament features a round-robin format, where players compete in a first round consisting of two groups of four. Each group is a round-robin of six matches, where each player in a group will meet the other three in turn. The top two players in each group advance to the semifinals, where the winners of a group face the runners-up of the other group. The winners of the semifinals meet in the final to determine the champion.\n\nAside from the prestige that comes with being one of the select few who qualify for the event, and the sizable prize money and ranking points it offers, the ATP Finals is considered the fifth most prestigious tournament of the year, behind only the four Grand Slams."

Since a, b, c, d are all between 0 and 9, it follows that d - c + b - a is between -18 and 18. There are 39 total numbers in this range, four of which [0, 11, -11, -22 for (0, 0)], are divisible by 11. So there are 4 possible residue classes for any number that is divisible by 11.\n\nSince all numbers from 0 to 9999 inclusive are equally likely, it follows that the desired probability is 4/39."

There are five stages of sleep that occur during a typical sleep cycle, including four stages of non-REM sleep and one stage of REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep: 1. **Stage 1:** The first stage of sleep is a transitional phase that lasts for 5-10 minutes, during which you begin to fall asleep. Your brain produces alpha and theta waves, your muscles start to relax, and your breathing, heartbeat, and eye movements slow down. 2. **Stage 2:** The second stage of sleep is light sleep that lasts around 20 minutes. You become disengaged from your surroundings, your breathing and heart rate become regular, and your body temperature decreases. The brain produces short bursts of rapid, rhythmic brain wave activity known as sleep spindles. 3. **Stage 3:** The third stage of sleep is deep sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep. It lasts for around 30 minutes during the first cycle and longer during subsequent cycles. Your breathing and heartbeat slow down, your muscles relax even further, and you become less responsive to external stimuli. 4. **Stage 4:** The fourth stage of sleep is the deepest stage of non-REM sleep, during which the brain produces delta waves. You are least responsive to your environment, and it is difficult to wake up. This stage is also known as restorative sleep, as it refreshes the body and helps with growth, repair, and immune function. 5. **REM Sleep:** The fifth stage of sleep is REM sleep, during which rapid eye movement and increased brain activity occur. The first REM cycle of the night usually starts around 90 minutes after falling asleep, and each subsequent cycle gets longer. During REM sleep, your breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure become more irregular, and your body becomes temporarily paralyzed, likely to prevent you from acting out your dreams.

For instance, to find the number of products sold in June 2021 you'll write: ``` SELECT SUM(quantity) as Products_Sold FROM orders WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 6 AND YEAR(order_date) = 2021; ```"}

Being a global citizen means taking an active interest in the lives and wellbeing of others, no matter where they live. It also means recognizing that we all share a responsibility to take care of the world we live in, and to treat it in a way that will allow future generations to enjoy its beauty. What makes a global citizen? Being a global citizen is not just about your physical location; it's also about your mindset. Global citizens are people who think globally and act locally. This means thinking and caring about global issues like climate change, poverty, health, and security, while also taking action at home to make a difference. At the core of being a global citizen are the values of respect, empathy, and responsibility. Respect for other cultures, languages, and ways of life is essential. Empathy allows us to put ourselves in others' shoes and understand their perspective. And responsibility means taking action to make a positive impact, whether that be through volunteering, donating to charities, or engaging in political activism. Benefits of being a global citizen Being a global citizen not only allows us to make a positive impact on the world, it also allows us to grow and develop as individuals. By opening ourselves up to new cultures and ideas, we learn more about the world and enhance our understanding of our place in it. This exposure to diverse perspectives and ways of life also fosters tolerance and understanding, helping us to build stronger, more cohesive communities. How to become a global citizen Becoming a global citizen starts with educating yourself about the world. This can be as simple as reading the news or watching documentaries about different countries and cultures. Traveling is also an excellent way to immerse yourself in new environments and learn firsthand about the lives of others. But you don't need to go far to become a global citizen.

Being a global citizen means taking an active interest in the lives and wellbeing of others, no matter where they live. It also means recognizing that we all share a responsibility to take care of the world we live in, and to treat it in a way that will allow future generations to enjoy its beauty. What makes a global citizen? Being a global citizen is not just about your physical location; it's also about your mindset. Global citizens are people who think globally and act locally. This means thinking and caring about global issues like climate change, poverty, health, and security, while also taking action at home to make a difference. At the core of being a global citizen are the values of respect, empathy, and responsibility. Respect for other cultures, languages, and ways of life is essential. Empathy allows us to put ourselves in others' shoes and understand their perspective. And responsibility means taking action to make a positive impact, whether that be through volunteering, donating to charities, or engaging in political activism. Benefits of being a global citizen Being a global citizen not only allows us to make a positive impact on the world, it also allows us to grow and develop as individuals. By opening ourselves up to new cultures and ideas, we learn more about the world and enhance our understanding of our place in it. This exposure to diverse perspectives and ways of life also fosters tolerance and understanding, helping us to build stronger, more cohesive communities. How to become a global citizen Becoming a global citizen starts with educating yourself about the world. This can be as simple as reading the news or watching documentaries about different countries and cultures. Traveling is also an excellent way to immerse yourself in new environments and learn firsthand about the lives of others. But you don't need to go far to become a global citizen. Getting involved in your local community and volunteering at organizations that support global causes is also a great way to make a difference. Engaging in political activism, such as contacting your elected representatives and participating in marches or protests, is another way to promote positive change. Conclusion Being a global citizen is about taking a global perspective on the world and actively working to make it a better place. By embracing the values of respect, empathy, and responsibility, we can all play a role in creating a more just and sustainable world. So why not start today and take the first step towards becoming a global citizen?"}

Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there lived a powerful witch named Morgana. Morgana lived in a secluded cabin deep in the forest, where she practiced her spells and potions. Morgana had many magical items, including her cauldron, wand, and spellbook, but her most prized possession was her magical broom. Morgana's broom was not just any ordinary broom; it was a broom that was imbued with powerful magic. The broom was made from the finest birchwood, with bristles of horsehair and a handle finished with gold. A spell had been cast upon the broom, allowing it to fly faster than a bird and take its rider wherever she desired. The broom had been given to Morgana by her grandmother, who was also a powerful witch. Her grandmother had told her that the broom was enchanted by the moonlight and could only be ridden by a true witch. Morgana cherished the broom and took excellent care of it, polishing the handle and oiling the bristles every day. One day, while Morgana was out collecting herbs in the forest, a group of villagers stumbled upon her cabin. They saw her broom and, not understanding its magical powers, thought it was just an ordinary broom. They took the broom and brought it back to their village, where they tried to use it to sweep their floors. But the broom had other ideas. It began to buck and twist, whisking the villagers off their feet and sending them flying through the air. The villagers were terrified and didn't know what to do. Morgana, who had returned to her cabin, saw what was happening and raced to the village to retrieve her broom. When she arrived, she scolded the villagers for taking something that didn't belong to them. The villagers were ashamed and begged for her forgiveness. Morgana forgave them and, with a wave of her hand, mounted her broom and flew off into the sky. From that day on, the villagers knew that Morgana was a powerful witch, and they never again dared to disturb her or take anything that belonged to her.

Animals, like all living organisms, have evolved mechanisms to adapt to their environment and increase their chances of survival. Adaptation refers to the changes in an animal's physical, behavioral, or physiological traits that enable it to better cope with the conditions of its habitat, be it a desert or a rainforest. These changes occur over many generations and are driven by natural selection, whereby traits that confer an advantage to survival and reproduction become more common in subsequent generations. Physical adaptations can involve changes to an animal's body shape, coloration, or structure. For example, polar bears have thick fur to keep them warm in their cold Arctic environment. Animals living in desert environments such as camels have developed the ability to store water and withstand long periods of time without drinking. Behavioral adaptations refer to changes in an animal's behavior patterns that enable them to thrive in their environment. For example, many desert animals are nocturnal, meaning they are active at night when conditions are cooler. Some animals, such as birds, migrate to warmer areas during winter to avoid harsh conditions. Physiological adaptations involve changes to an animal's metabolism, internal processes, or biochemistry. For instance, the Australian Thorny Devil can collect water via capillary action along grooves in its skin, allowing them to absorb water from their surroundings. The key to adaptation is flexibility - the ability to change in response to changing conditions. Different environments pose different challenges, and animals must be able to adjust their behavior or physical characteristics to meet those challenges. Over time, the populations that are best adapted to their environment will thrive, while those that cannot adapt will eventually die out.\n\nConvert the text in to a question Input: The meeting will be held in the boardroom.", "Will the meeting be held in the boardroom?"]], "resps": [[[-1.6552734375, false]]], "filtered_resps": [[-1.6552734375, false]], "incontext_doc_id": 90, "incontext_doc": "How do animals adapt to their environment?

Reminiscing those moments of bliss we shared, Our hearts now heavy, our souls bared, Oh how we wish we could go back in time, To undo the wrongs and make things right. But alas, time waits for no one, you see, Even love, once strong, must bend its knee, And all that is left, when love falls apart, Is the bitter taste of regret in our heart. Yet even in the midst of all this pain, We hold onto the hope, that love will remain, For though regrets may linger, all is not lost, For love and regret, are but two sides of the same coin, tossed."}

The Iron Law of Oligarchy is a political theory that asserts that, in any given organization, power will inevitably become consolidated in the hands of a small group of elite leaders or oligarchs. Even in democratic organizations that attempt to be egalitarian, the theory suggests that certain individuals will rise to the top and establish a dominant position, creating an oligarchy. The concept of the Iron Law of Oligarchy was first outlined by German sociologist Robert Michels in his 1911 book, Political Parties. Michels posited that in any organization or society, there is a need for a small group to take charge of coordinating and managing its activities. These people, often with superior skills, knowledge, or resources, become the leaders and hold a disproportionate amount of power. Over time, Michels argued that these leaders will work to maintain their power by controlling access to information, limiting the decision-making role of the broader membership, and making the organizational structure more bureaucratic to provide stability for their positions. As a result, the organization becomes less democratic and more oligarchic.

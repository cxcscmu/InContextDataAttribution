Two pros of using artificial intelligence include: 1. Efficiency: AI systems are able to process large amounts of data at a faster rate than humans, and can automate repetitive tasks, increasing productivity and reducing the risk of human error. 2. Improved Decision-making: AI systems can analyze data and provide insights that can help humans make better and more informed decisions. Two cons of using artificial intelligence include: 1. Job Displacement: AI systems can automate repetitive tasks and perform them more efficiently, leading to job displacement for workers in certain industries. 2. Dependency on Technology: As AI systems become more advanced and integrated into daily life, there is a risk of humans becoming overly dependent on technology, potentially losing skills and knowledge that are important for independent problem-solving and critical thinking."}

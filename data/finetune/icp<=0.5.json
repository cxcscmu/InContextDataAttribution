Then I remember the first men and their caves,\nHow I laughed when they called me the Sea of Waves!\nThey made their gods of wood and stone,\nBut I was older than them all alone.\n\n\"When the Romans came with a heavy hand. Their palisades beside me stand,\nI remember their ships and their smart attacks\nAnd the time when C\u00e6sar nearly backed his pack.\nBut nothing that I remember more\nThan Queen Bess and the Spanish war,\nWhen the houses shook, and the ships were afeared\nAnd I the old Thames, carried the canard.\n\n\"Then there was a man with a stick in his clutch.\nRaising it high, with a shaking touch,\nAnd that was Nelson, in 'tween the guns,\nAnd that was the end of the Spanish plans.\n\"And now I'm watching the sweeter sight \u2013\nThe Tower Bridge, all in the light,\nWatching the yacht that is standing by;\nAnd the folk that wonder as they go by.\"\n\nSo, from the sad tale of the River's past,\nComes the triumphant trumpet blast \u2013\nIn the mighty walls of the Tower fort,\nThe Thames whispers on in its lordly sort."

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",
      "output": "The paper investigates the relationship between continuous prompts and their discrete projections in fine-tuning language models for target tasks. The authors observed a \"wayward\" behavior where continuous prompts can solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text, with a very small margin from the best prompt. This behavior increases with larger model sizes. This has significant implications for interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization. The paper provides intuitions and empirical analysis to guide future progress in prompting language models."

It discusses possible scenarios along with paths to attain superintelligence, its dangers and strategies to deal with them.\n\n3. **\"The Society of Mind\"** by Marvin Minsky - Regarded as a pioneer in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Marvin Minsky provides a theory based on how intelligence arises from the non-intelligent functioning of the brain\u2019s component parts. The book introduces various ideas and concepts that help to understand the AI better.\n\n4. **\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\"** by Alan Turing - Although not a book, this paper, written in 1950 by Alan Turing, is one of the most essential contributions to the field of AI. In this paper, Turing introduces the concept of the Turing test, which is still considered as a standard criterion to evaluate machine intelligence.\n\n5. **\"Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction\"** by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto \u2013 Reinforcement learning is an important type of machine learning that deals with how agents should take actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. This book is instrumental in providing an introduction to the field of reinforcement learning in a simple and intuitive manner."

Motivated by these promising results, we investigate the feasibility of extracting a discrete (textual) interpretation of continuous prompts that is faithful to the problem they solve. In practice, we observe a \"wayward\" behavior between the task solved by continuous prompts and their nearest neighbor discrete projections: We can find continuous prompts that solve a task while being projected to an arbitrary text (e.g., definition of a different or even a contradictory task), while being within a very small (2%) margin of the best continuous prompt of the same size for the task. We provide intuitions behind this odd and surprising behavior, as well as extensive empirical analyses quantifying the effect of various parameters. For instance, for larger model sizes we observe higher waywardness, i.e, we can find prompts that more closely map to any arbitrary text with a smaller drop in accuracy. These findings have important implications relating to the difficulty of faithfully interpreting continuous prompts and their generalization across models and tasks, providing guidance for future progress in prompting language models.",
